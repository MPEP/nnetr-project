Description: A basic implementation of the perceptron algorithm for educational
	     purposes based on the perceptron model as described by Frank
	     Rosenblatt (1958). The algorithm employs an error backpropagation
	     mechanism to formulate  a linear predictor function by modifying the
	     the coefficients of a given feature set accroding to a set of
	     desired output values. Because of the binary nature of the output
	     value, in its basic form, the algorithm is only applicable to
	     linearly seperable dataset in the context of a binary classification
	     task.
